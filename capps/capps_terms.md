* We therefore recommend that **you do not jailbreak or root your phone**, _which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device._ It **could make your phone vulnerable** to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that our apps won’t work properly or at all.

## **4. THIRD PARTY SERVICES**

Most of our apps use trusted third party services **to provide a seamless user experience** that would have taken us decades to implement. That's why we use these services in our apps so that we only focus on what we do best, and that is **Cross-Platform App Development**, while the third parties take care of the rest.

However, some of the third party services may collect information used to identify you according to their privacy policies too. **But, you don't need to worry because we are in close partnerships and relations with these services and monitor how they use your information which we choose to share with them, so that your information is still safe.**

## **5. INTERNET CONNECTION**

You should be aware that there are certain things that **THE C APPS TEAM** will not take responsibility for.

**Certain functions of our apps will require them to have an active internet connection**. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but **THE C APPS TEAM** cannot take responsibility for our apps not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using our apps outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing any of our apps, or other third party charges.
